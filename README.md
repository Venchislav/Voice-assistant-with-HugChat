# Voice-assistant-with-Bard
I created my own voice assistant with Google Bard using unofficial BardAPI.

Link to unofficial BardAPI and it's docs: https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/tree/main <br>
TTS by silero: https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models/tree/master <br>

P.S: I used RU tts models and RU speech recognition(as I made this project for personal use), but you can easily change language.
Google Bard can speak different languages)
