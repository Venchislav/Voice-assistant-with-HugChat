# VoiceAssistant-with-HugChat
I created my own voice assistant with Google Bard using open source HugChat.

TTS by silero: https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models/tree/master <br>
I also made TelegramBot with it: https://t.me/GoogleBartBot

P.S: I used RU tts models and RU speech recognition(as I made this project for personal use), but you can easily change language.
HugChat can speak different languages)
